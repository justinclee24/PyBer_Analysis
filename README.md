# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to inform executives of PyBer, including CEO, V. Isualize, of the statistics of average fares per ride and driver, along with totals for rides, drivers, and fare among the three different city types within the ride-sharing data. With these stats, we can derive some conclusions as to which direction the company should take to increase the overall performance of the ride-sharing application. 

## Results
Based on the Pyber Summary table (shown below), urban cities outperform suburban and especially rural cities/towns by a wide margin. Urban areas have about 13x and 2.6x more total rides than rural and suburban areas, respectively. They also have roughly 30x and 5x more drivers than rural and suburban areas, respectively. This popularity in urban areas equates to having 9x more total fare than rural areas, and 2x more than suburban places. Conversely, rural and suburban take the lead in categories where it is not preferable to have it. In both categories, Average Fare per Ride and per Driver, rural areas have the highest statistic, and urban areas have the lowest.

When taking a look at Total Fare by City Type, you can easily gather that the urban category has much higher revenues than suburban, and particularly the rural category. The week urban cities had their maximum fare is about 5x higher than the maximum fare week for rural areas, and about 1.8x higher than suburban areas.

## Summary
Based on the results of this analysis, a few recommendations should be given to the CEO and other exectutives to address the disparities among the different city types. First, more resources need to be allocated to rural areas to increase the volume of rides. This will result in lower average fares, making the service more appealing in the minds of rural citizens. There are definitely higher populations in urban cities, however, that does not have to stop rural citizens from using the ride-sharing service more often. The same can be said about suburban areas as well. 

Also, the volume of fare over time has not grown significantly for any of the city types, but especially for the rural category. Executives should place high priority on increasing these numbers within the next few quarters possibly through more aggressive marketing and product development. 

Finally, a bit relevant to the first point, the number of drivers in rural as well as suburban areas needs to increase as the total rides does. Executives should focus on hiring reliable, safe drivers here so that as usage in rural and suburban places start to increase, the trend stays that way.
